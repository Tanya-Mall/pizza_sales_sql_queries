Project Overview
This project involves performing SQL-based data analysis on a pizza database. The database consists of various tables that capture information related to pizza orders, customers, ingredients, and delivery details. 
The purpose of this analysis is to gain insights into business operations, customer preferences, and overall trends in pizza consumption.

Key Objectives
Customer Insights: Identify customer preferences, ordering habits, and loyalty patterns.
Sales Analysis: Analyze sales performance by pizza type, size, and ingredient combinations.
Operational Efficiency: Examine delivery times, peak order hours, and other operational metrics to improve efficiency.
Trend Identification: Detect trends in pizza consumption over time, such as seasonal demand or popular topping combinations.

SQL Queries
The analysis is conducted using SQL queries to perform tasks such as:
Retrieving and filtering data
Joining multiple tables for comprehensive insights
Aggregating data for summary statistics
Analyzing patterns with advanced queries (e.g., subqueries, window functions)


How to Use
Database Setup: Ensure you have the pizza database installed on your SQL server. The structure should include tables for orders, customers, pizzas, ingredients, and deliveries.
Query Execution: Run the provided SQL queries in your SQL environment to generate analysis reports. Modify the queries as needed to fit your specific database schema or analytical focus.
Interpretation: Review the query results to draw conclusions that can help in decision-making for pizza-related operations.
